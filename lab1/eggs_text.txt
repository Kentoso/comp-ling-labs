Fried eggs are a simple yet versatile dish, enjoyed in many cultures around the world. Made by cooking an egg in a heated pan with a bit of oil or butter, they can be prepared in several different ways depending on personal preference.

The basic method involves cracking the egg into a preheated pan and allowing it to cook without stirring. As the egg cooks, the white becomes firm, while the yolk remains runny or solidifies, depending on how long it's left on the heat. There are different styles of fried eggs, each offering a unique texture and experience.

A "sunny-side up" egg is cooked on one side only, with the yolk remaining soft and bright, resembling the sun. In contrast, an "over-easy" egg is flipped partway through cooking, leaving the yolk still runny but giving it a thin cooked layer on top. "Over-medium" eggs have a firmer yolk, while "over-hard" eggs are fully cooked through, with both the white and yolk solid.

Fried eggs can be enjoyed on their own, served with toast, or paired with a variety of dishes like rice, bacon, or salads. Their simplicity allows them to complement savory and sweet flavors alike. Additionally, they are often seasoned with salt, pepper, and sometimes herbs or spices, adding depth to their flavor.

Despite being easy to make, the technique of frying eggs can require some practice to achieve the perfect texture, whether you're aiming for a crispy edge, a soft yolk, or a balance between the two.
