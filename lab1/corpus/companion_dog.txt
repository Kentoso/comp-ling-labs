A companion dog is a dog which is not primarily a working dog but a pet. The primary function of a companion dog is not to perform a useful job but to provide companionship to humans. A companion dog can also be called an emotional support animal and is used to help people with mental health disabilities cope with symptoms. Most dogs can be companions, including many working dog breeds such as retrievers, who are enjoyed primarily for their friendly nature as a pet. Most toy dog breeds are used only for the pleasure of their company, not as workers. The American Kennel Club also offers a Companion dog title for judged dog obedience competitions.
