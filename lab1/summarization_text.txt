Extractive summarization works by selecting key sentences or phrases directly from a text and combining them to form a shorter version. It doesn't generate any new language but rather pulls out what seems most important from the original content. This approach relies on algorithms to identify the most relevant parts of the text, often based on things like how often words appear or where sentences are positioned. While this method keeps the exact wording of the original text, it sometimes lacks flow because it’s just piecing together fragments without changing them.

Abstractive summarization, on the other hand, involves generating new sentences that capture the main ideas of the text. Instead of pulling directly from the original wording, it rephrases and condenses the content in its own words. This approach is more complex because it tries to understand the meaning of the text and then produce a summary that is both concise and coherent. Though the results can be more natural and readable, creating new sentences means there’s a chance the model might miss some nuances or misinterpret certain details.

Both approaches aim to condense information, but extractive summarization relies on cutting and pasting from the original text, while abstractive summarization creates an entirely new version that captures the core ideas in fewer words.
